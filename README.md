# Louis-Module-12-SQL
## Description
I've been task with making an employee tracker. I have created code for index.js and dbfolder containing javascript and sql code.
I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role when I start the application.
I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids when I choose to view all departments.
I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role when I choose to view all roles.
I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to when I choose to view all employees.
I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database when I choose to add a department.
I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database when I choose to add a role.
I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database when I choose to add an employee.
I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database when I choose to update an employee role.
Lastly, I made sure to leave the code well documented and free of errors.
